GNNDO Enhancing MovieLens Link Prediction with Recommender-Driven Inputs
Overview
This project invites students to explore and enhance a baseline model for link prediction on the MovieLens dataset using a provided Colab notebook 9. Link Prediction on MovieLens.ipynb - Colab. The initial goal is to understand and test the default configurations of the model. Subsequently, students can extend the baseline by incorporating additional inputs, such as recommendations generated by a chosen recommender system. This extension aligns with methodologies explored in computational and cognitive neuroscience, including the integration of multimodal and hierarchical information.

Phases of the Project:

Initial Setup and Testing (mandatory):

Familiarize with the MovieLens dataset (users, movies, and ratings).

Implement the baseline heterogeneous graph model for link prediction to predict missing links (ratings) between users and movies.

Test and analyze different configurations of the provided Colab code, experimenting with hyperparameters, optimizers, and loss functions.

Extension with Recommender Systems (optional):

read: Guidotti, Sabrina, et al. "Modeling Social Media Recommendation Impacts Using Academic Networks: A Graph Neural Network Approach." arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.04552 (2024).

Select a recommender algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based, or hybrid) to generate movie recommendations for users.

Simulate additional input features for the model, such as:

User preferences derived from recommender outputs.

Contextual or temporal features (e.g., genre trends or time-specific preferences).

Incorporate these features into the graph model to enhance its predictive capabilities.

Evaluation and Comparison:

Compare the performance of the baseline and extended models using metrics like prediction accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

Assess the influence of added features on prediction robustness and generalizability.

Relevant paper:

Learning Outcomes:

Understand the principles of link prediction in heterogeneous graphs.

Gain hands-on experience with recommender systems and their integration into graph-based models.

Develop skills in experimental design, hyperparameter tuning, and result interpretation.

Explore interdisciplinary connections between AI-driven recommendation and cognitive modeling.

Potential Extensions:

Explore the use of multimodal data (e.g., user reviews or tags) to enrich input features.

Integrate advanced embeddings from pre-trained language models to represent user or movie metadata.
